    <div class="intro">
        <p> My name is Nick Faulkner and I am currently a sophomore at Brown University. I was born and raised in a small tourist town called Homer, Alaska (the picture above was taken in Homer of its famous Katchemak Bay). For high school, I decided to attend Phillips Academy Andover in Andover, Massachusetts. After four amazing years at Andover, I then chose to attend Brown University.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my freshman fall at Brown, I spontaneously decided to take an introductory computer science class, as it was something I had never done before but was very interested in. After a semester of hard work, I found that I absolutely loved it and plan to pursue a major in it. My passion for computer science lies largely in using it to create programs that allow people to take advantage of our greatest resource: each other. I admire modern day companies that use technology to bring people together for mutual benefit. Developing and making these sorts of technologies easy to use and accessible to everyone is a goal I have for myself moving forward.

  <p> During the summer after my freshman year of college, my friends and I were looking for concerts in the Boston area. I found it extremely frustrating that there was no way to have a "favorite artists" list on ticketmaster or stubhub. This was the beginnings of my idea for Tix. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Using Spotify and Ticketmaster's API, Tix allows you to conveniently view all of the concerts for your top artist on Spotify. I developed Tix completely on my own, and it helped me gain a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience using API's and developing a website in general. As of right now, 35 new people use Tix each day, and this number is still growing as I continue to develop its functionality.

  <p> As the final project to my introductory computer science class, I had to choose from a variety of games to make from scrath,
    and I chose Pacman. Built in Java, using object-oriented programming, I created Pacman completely on my own, without any stencil
    code. For the ghosts searching functionality, I created an algorithm that uses breadth first search of the board to continuously
    update the ghost's target location.

    Black Duck Software is an open source risk management firm with three hundred full time employees and nearly eighty million dollars in annual revenue. By scanning clients’ code, Black Duck identifies every open-source components used in a company's software. Utilizing its deep knowledge base, Black Duck identifies the licenses and security risks associated with each open-source component, and then evaluates the danger for the company in having those open-source components in their code. Black Duck's notable partners include Google, HP, and RedHat, and a few of its notable customers include Samsung, Intel, NASA, Uber, Verizon, BP, and Reddit.
    </p>

   <p> 
	The summer after my freshman year of college, I worked at Black Duck as a Sales Engineer Intern. As a Sales Engineer Intern, I worked closely with both the software engineering and business teams. A majority of my time was spent working alongside the integrations team to develop new functionality for our products. I spent several weeks developing a program in Java that would identify open-source dependencies in projects written in R, a language used mostly for data science. This program was then implemented into he company's main product: Black Duck Hub-Detect. In addition to programming, I was also able to experience the business side of technology and understand better the nuance of how deals are made with customers in the tech industry. Specifically, providing proof of concepts and demos for customers helped me gain a deep knowledge of Black Duck’s product and how to implement it.

 	Land's End Resort is year-round resort in Homer, Alaska. The resort is comprised of a high-end restaurant, spa, several condos, and more than three hundred rooms. Land’s End Resort employs about seventy-five employees each year. I started working at Land's End the summer before my freshman year of highschool. I worked as a member of Land's End housekeeping team for two summers cleaning hotel rooms and washing laundry to remake the rooms. After two summers as a housekeeper, I moved to the maintenance team, where I was involved in everything from painting, landscaping, construction, and fixing appliances, to picking up guests at the airport and carrying their bags. For the summers after my junior and senior years of highschool, I worked in Land's End's restaurant as a busser and food runner/expeditor.
